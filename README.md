**Development build. Please be cauious using on real cases.**

Framework for Logs, Events, And Plists Parser (LEAPP)

This framework is a complete rewrite of the excellent tool iLEAPP.Details of iLEAPP can be found in this [blog post](https://abrignoni.blogspot.com/2019/12/xleapp-ios-logs-events-and-properties.html)

xLEAPP is the framework created to merge several tools together. More information about the rewrite is given in by talk ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seTpCmSF0Gc)) at Black Hills Info Security&#39;s Wild West Hackin&#39; Fest (WWHF): Deadwood in 2021.

## VS Code configuration files

There are several [configuration files](https://github.com/flamusdiu/xleapp-project) that I have been using for VS Code.

## Compile to executable

**NOTE:** This may not work at this time with this alpha version.

To compile to an executable so you can run this on a system without python installed.

To create xleapp.exe, run:

```bash
pyinstaller --onefile xleapp.spec
```

To create xleappGUI.exe, run:

```bash
pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole xleappGUI.spec
```

```bash
$ xleapp -h
usage: xleapp [-h] [-I] [-R] [-A] [-C] [-V] [-o OUTPUT_FOLDER] [-i INPUT_PATH]
