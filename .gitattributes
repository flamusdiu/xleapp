# Specific project files to override
# ============

# Poetry is inconsistent with the way it generates files, so in some cases we
# have to force them to the correct line ending in the run script or the
# pre-commit hooks.  We don't bother doing that with poetry.lock, since its
# format is considered an implementation detail of Poetry itself.

# Note: .db, .p, and .pkl files are associated
# with the python modules ``pickle``, ``dbm.*``,
# ``shelve``, ``marshal``, ``anydbm``, & ``bsddb``
# (among others).
